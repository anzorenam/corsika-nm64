# corsika-nm64
Corsika simulation for NM64 in Mexico city.
The simulation runs in 4 parallel CPU to accelerate calculation (approx 8 hrs in Intel i7).

The output data requires 200GB of space.

We estimate the number of energy spectrum of different species (neutron-meprod.py)  and the aperture of the shower (part_position.py).
The software requires another 2hrs to produce the results.
